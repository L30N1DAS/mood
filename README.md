## Rationale

**Welcome to you're doom!**

Ahem, I mean welcome to the PCB design portion of your summer camp!

This project was selected to introduce a variety of topics including:

* Circuit schematics / basic electronics
* PCB design (Computer-Aided Design using KiCAD)
* Hardware / Software trojans
* Hardware / Software bugs

By the end of these two weeks you will have a basic understanding of how to 
layout and build a basic circuit and what vulnerabilities it may have 
unintentional or otherwise).

## Safety

A (brief) word on safety.  All of the equipment and materials used in this project
are safe, so long as they are used properly.

Our goal is to make sure that over the two weeks of this project you are instructed 
on how to perform each of the steps needed to manufacture a PCB safely.  **Please do
NOT turn on any of the machines or use any of the equipment until you have had the 
safety overview for that equipment or process.** 

Similarly, if you are unsure on the safe way to perform some process just ask one of 
our several lab assitants.  We are happy to help!  There will be additional safety
instructions covered over the course of the two weeks and all relevant safety documents
will be kept in the `Safety` folder in this repository.

## Bill of materials

Most of the materials have already been inlcuded in your Elegoo kit.  These include:

* Arduino project board
* Various items from the elegoo kit

Other items needed include:

* Copper clad PCB board
* various electronic components

## The Circuit

The circuit started as this:

## KiCAD

We will be using the open source Computer-Aided Drawing / Electronics Design Automation (CAD/EDA) suite [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).  This software can be installed freely on Windows/Mac/Linuxand is very powerful.  Further documentation and cheatsheets can be found in the `KiCad` folder of this repository.

## Design

To be designed...
